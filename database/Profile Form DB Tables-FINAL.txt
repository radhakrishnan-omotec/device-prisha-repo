Following are the metrics for the profile section


1. general progress score 
2. daily/weekly/monthly activity summary 
3. activity completion rate 
4. motor skills improvement 
5. cognitive skills progress
6. preferred activities
7. adaptive adjustments (showing how the device is personalizing the experience)
8.  Progress towards specific therapeutic goals set by healthcare professionals+ goals that are to be achieved now 



Here is the review of the tables- 
Table 1. 
- Can we change the score subsections to- comprehension score, behavioural score and skills score
Table 1,6 and 7  
- I don't think the date is necessary here 
Table 6,7 
- How will the information be structured? because in categories like preferred activities or adjustments that the device has made, there will be multiple entries. So, will it be displayed in different rows? If not, we can change these tables into summaries of the preferred activity and device adjustments.
